to get the data we will be using onSnapShot(). there is another method called detData it can also be used to get the data
the difference is
    onSnapShot = listen for real time updates, to stop this we can use the empty array at the end 
    getData = get the data only once
use the useEffect method will working with data like getting data from the firbase

uploading a data in firestore
    1.setDoc from firestore.

            const handleChange = async ()=> {
      const docref = doc(db,"colors","color001");
      const payload = {color:"black",value:"#001"}
      await setDoc(docref,payload)
    }

    2. while working with api we should use async, await

    3.addDoc()
            const userRef = collection(db,"users",userId);
        const payload = {
            name:name,
            email: email, // Replace with actual user email
            
        };
              await addDoc(userRef,payload);

 npm install react-router-dom
